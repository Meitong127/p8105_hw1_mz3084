## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Q1 
**Load the penguins dataset**


```{r load the penguins dataset}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The `penguins` dataset includes the variables `species`, `island`, `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`, `sex`, and `year`. The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is approximately 200.9152 mm.

**Plot**
```{r}
scatter_plot= ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() 
scatter_plot
ggsave("scatter_plot.png")
```
## Q2

set up the data frame.
```{r}
set.seed(8888)
## set seed to ensure reproducibility

df= tibble(
  ran_var= rnorm(10), 
  logical_vector = ran_var > 0,
  char_vector= letters[1:10],                        
  factor_vector= gl(3,3, length=10, labels = c("level1", "level2", "level3"))
)

df
```
Find the mean by numeric non-number variables.
```{r, results = 'hide'}

set.seed(8888)
# convert character and factor into numeric
numeric_character = as.numeric(pull(df, char_vector), na.rm = TRUE)  
numeric_factor = as.numeric(pull(df, factor_vector), na.rm = TRUE) 

# Attempt to take the mean of each variable
mean_ran_var = mean(pull(df, ran_var)) 
mean_logical = mean(pull(df, logical_vector))  
mean_character = mean(numeric_character) 
mean_factor = mean(numeric_factor)

# Display the results
mean_ran_var
mean_logical
mean_character
mean_factor
```
